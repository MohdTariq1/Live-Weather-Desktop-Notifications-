# Live-Weather-Desktop-Notifications-
I am introducing the logic and script with some easiest way to understand for everyone. Let’s see a simple Python script to show the live update for Weather information.
Modules Needed
In this script, we are using some libraries

bs4: Beautiful Soup(bs4) is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. To install this module type the below command in the terminal.
pip install bs4
win10toast: This library helps in creating desktop notifications. To install this module type the below command in the terminal.
pip install win10toast
requests: This library allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. To install this module type the below command in the terminal.
pip install requests

Approach :
Extract data form given URL.
Scrape the data with the help of requests and Beautiful Soup.
Convert that data into html code.
Find the required details and filter them.
Save the result in the String.
Pass the result in Notification object.
Let’s execute the script step-by-step :


Step 1: Import all dependence
import requests 
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup 
from win10toast import ToastNotifier 


Step 2: Create an object of ToastNotifier class.
n = ToastNotifier() 


Step 3: Define a function for getting data from the given url.
def getdata(url): 
    
    r = requests.get(url) 
      
    return r.text

    
Step 4: Now pass the URL into the getdata function and Convert that data into HTML code.
htmldata = getdata("https://weather.com/en-IN/weather/today/l/25.59,85.14?par=google&temp=c/") 
  soup = BeautifulSoup(htmldata, 'html.parser') 
  print(soup.prettify()) 
After executing this script you will get raw data like these:
Raw HTML information 



Step 5: Find the required details and filter them 
current_temp = soup.find_all("span",  
                             class_=" _-_-components-src-organism-CurrentConditions-CurrentConditions--tempValue--MHmYY") 
chances_rain = soup.find_all("div",  
                             class_= "_-_-components-src-organism-CurrentConditions-CurrentConditions--precipValue--2aJSf") 
  
temp = (str(current_temp))    
temp_rain = str(chances_rain) 
  
result = "current_temp " + temp[128:-9] + "  in patna bihar" + "\n" +temp_rain[131
